I’m giving you the source code of the 2009 program “wbfs_file”.
I use it like “./wbfs_file input_iso.iso”. I don’t use any flag, or change the default behavior.
I want to replicate this behavior in python, also specifying the output directory. I’m only interested in the default behavior of the original program.
Seek the relevant C code parts, and translate them to Python.
Keep in mind that the original implementation may be compiled for x86_32 only.
The split size must be always 4gb-32kb.
Replicate also the decryption, scrubbing and all the behavior of the original program.
Produce a clean, organized, optimized and production ready drop in python script “iso2wbfs.py”, with extensive logging for debugging (toggled with -v/—verbose) and progress indicator.
Use the cryptography and tqdm libraries (tqdm optional, don’t log progress if missing).
The script must create the output dir if nonexistent.
It’s very important that the output is bit-per-bit identical to the one of the original program.
